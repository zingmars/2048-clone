2048 clone written in Delphi
===

An older project of mine that I wrote for a school project back in 2014. Uploaded for preservation purposes. Project was written in Delphi. Probably has some bugs, but it worked well enough when I presented it.

Since this was a school project, the UI and comments are in Latvian. To play the game just press "Sākt spēli". To see your high-scores click "Rekordi". To exit either use title bar's X button, or the "Iziet" button on the main menu. Controls are the same as the original game.
